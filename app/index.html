          <p class="bio-leader">James believes that talking in the third person in order to blow his own trumpet is utterly inexcusable.

                  <p>In 2009 James co-founded The Philter Phactory, an internet startup that aggregated, parsed and spliced social media feeds into bespoke autonomous social agents. These agents could be crafted into rich and detailed personas, perhaps to embody a particular demographic and would autonomously follow a daily routine about which they posted on their blogs. The public version of this was launched in 2010 as <a href="http://weavrs.com/" rel="external">weavrs.com</a>,<sup><a href="#note1" class="note">*</a></sup> provoking a good deal of interest in <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-03/28/weavrs-spambots-or-discoverability-agents">the media</a>. Alongside the public offering several private, bespoke versions of Weavrs were commissioned by large marketing agencies around the world.</p>

                  <p>As <strong>Head of Design</strong> at the Philter Phactory, James oversaw product user experience including the brand identities and logos for both the company and it's products, user interface design and information architecture, usability testing, the generation of proposal documents and presentations, the writing of documentation and coding the front-end functionality.</p>

                  <p>As <strong>Chief Culture Officer</strong> James was responsible for processing the daily deluge of cultural data to assess and anticipating future trends and cultural developments that could present opportunities for the company and it's products. He also monitored how the company's offerings measured up to it's competitors and remained relevant to it's users. An important aspect of this role was to establish and maintain an internal culture that was healthy, conducive to productivity and attracted and retained talented and motivated employees.</p>

                  <p>As a <strong>Co-founder</strong> James helped plan company strategy, attended monthly board meetings, met and presented to clients and helped manage and recruit developers, designers and researchers.</p>

                  <p>It's safe to say that this was quite a busy time. James left the company in 2012 in order to spend more time with his young family.</p>

                  <p class="note"><sup><a id="note1" class="note">*</a></sup><small>weavrs.com ceased operations early in 2013, due in part to significant changes to the Twitter API rules.</small></p>

                  <p>In 2002 James was asked to produce <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/song3/info/" rel="external">an app</a> for the online gallery due to mark the launch of the Sony PS2, which was being curated by <a href="http://hi-res.net/" rel="external">Hi-ReS!</a>. He later worked on several other projects for Hi-ReS! and it was around this time that he met the founder of <a href="http://greyworld.org/" rel="external">greyworld</a>, <a href="http://about.me/andrewshoben" rel="external">Andrew Shoben</a>. He went on to re-build and design <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atomless/sets/72157612522906660/" rel="external">greyworld's website</a>, created <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/the_source/images/" rel="external">an event scheduling controller interface</a> for <a href="http://greyworld.org/archives/31" rel="external">The Source</a>, the 32m high kinetic sculpture they created for the London stock exchange and worked on successful proposals for them, such as the one for <a href="http://greyworld.org/archives/46">Bins and Benches</a> and the bespoke software to create <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/woking/images/" rel="external">generative tile patterns</a> for the exterior of the new Woking Art Gallery.</p>

                  <p>Other clients during this period include <a href="http://gb.abrsm.org/en/home">The Associated Board Of The Royal Schools Of Music</a>, <a href="http://www.pokelondon.com/">Poke</a> and Kin Records.</p>

                  <p>James enjoyed an artist's residency in 2005 at the <a href="http://www.druh.co.uk/" rel="external">The Digital Research Unit</a> in Huddersfield and <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/sketchpad1/info/" rel="external">exhibited</a> at the Generative-X show, curated by <a href="http://www.danielbrowns.com/" rel="external">Daniel Brown</a> for the ICA in London and at exhibitions at Sonar in Barcelona and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, both curated by <a href="http://lia.sil.at/" rel="external">Lia</a> and <a href="http://carvalhais.org/" rel="external">Miguel</a>.</p>

                  <p>While living in Brighton James worked on several projects with the Bafta Award winning <a href="http://www.soda.co.uk/" rel="external">Soda Creative</a>. Including kiosk software to add messages to a giant LED ring in the London Science Museum and a prototype animation and story telling app for kids called Animoodle.</p>

                  <p>After moving to Dorset in 2006 James continued to work freelance and enjoyed working on several projects with <a href="http://kamvar.org/about" rel="external">Sep Kamvar</a>, including an independent online fashion brand complete with a custom built webstore and subsequently a mini-site for <a href="http://www.wefeelfine.org/book/" rel="external">the book version of We Feel Fine</a>, Kamvar's seminal social media art collaboration with <a href="http://www.number27.org/" rel="external">Johnathan Harris</a>.</p>

                  <p>Passing By, a personal project launched early in 2007, invited people to post clips to Youtube and tag them with either #passingby-looking-left or #passingby-looking-right. These clips were automatically sequenced into two seamless journeys by a custom web app, with each clip fading into another with a consistent direction of travel to form two ever growing collaborative movies. After a mention on Boing Boing the project garnered a good deal of attention and clips were contributed by people from all around the world, from Bolivia to the Trans Siberian Express.</p>

                  <p>James spent much of the first part of 2009 working with <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/campbellmckellar">Campbell Walmsley</a> to take LooseCubes from her initial vision to a working prototype. LooseCubes went on to become the world's largest office sharing community covering over 2000 locations in 74 countries.</p>

                  <p>During this period James also met his wife Abby, moved to Dorchester in Dorset and his two children were born. Exciting Times!</p>

Working part time at Digitas left him with the spare time he needed to focus on personal projects like <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/modifyme/site/" rel="me external">modifyme</a> and <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/algaerhythms/site/" rel="me external">algaerhythms</a> as well as his own client projects such as the site for <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/boc/site/" rel="me external">boardsofcanada</a>.</p>
                <p>Modifyme was awarded Best In Show in the <a href="http://bostoncyberarts.org/">Boston Cyberarts Festival</a> at the <a href="web.mit.edu/‎">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in  April, 2001 and James' site for Boards of Canada achieved a distinction in the Net Excellence category at <a href="www.aec.at/">Ars Electronica</a> in 2003.</p>
                <p>During the first 3 weeks of June, 2001, James built <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/mtvmg2/info/" rel="external">a browser based web app</a> for <a href="http://www.codemasters.com/uk/">Codemasters</a> as a promotional version of the MTV Music Generator II. Browser based music creation apps have <a href="http://www.audiotool.com/">come a <strong>long</strong> way since</a> but <a href="http://www.atomless.com/projects/mtvmg2/info/" rel="external">this</a> was one of the first to offer a fully functional eight track sample sequencer providing sequencable volume and pitch shifting events, a sample loop point editor, a pallette of beats and samples provided by <a href="http://gorillaz.com/">The Gorillaz</a> and the facility to save the songs you compose, both locally on your machine and up to the server from where other's could load, listen to and edit them.</p></dd>

              <p>He was such a pleasure to work with even though many of our discussions were had at 6am my time via Skype. He wrote the foundation for Loosecubes and helped me design what the site experience should be. He helped me interview and recruit additional developers to our team as well. Had we not lived so far away from each other I would have begged James to continue on and found the company with me. He's a creative mind and technical expert, but most of all he is a great friend and partner. I enjoyed every moment I spent working with James. He is incredibly fair about financial matters and treats you as a true thought partner.</p>
